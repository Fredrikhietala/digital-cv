## Fredrik Hietala

A curious software developer with great interest in learning new things. I'm driven and put my heart and soul in my projects. I'm able to effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate as part of a productive team.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Fredrikhietala/digital-cv/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
